According to the context provided, this assignment was inspired by our group members' love for card games. Someone proposed playing Niu Niu as part of the activity. The primary objective of this project is to achieve visualization and intuitive gameplay. To accomplish this, we specifically used Visual Basic to create a user-friendly interface that clearly displays each player's hand and result, making it easy for players to understand the game rules at a glance. Visualizing the game with Visual Basic allows players to learn quickly and provides real-time scoring and hand evaluation, enhancing both enjoyment and interaction.
