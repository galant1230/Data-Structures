Part 1: Fixed Shift Encoding/Decoding
Encoding:

Each letter is shifted two positions to the left in the alphabet (circular shift).
Example: A → C, B → D, Y → A, Z → B
Input is provided with a "+" symbol indicating encoding.
Decoding:

Each letter is shifted two positions to the right in the alphabet (circular shift).
Example: C → A, D → B, A → Y, B → Z
Input starts with a "- symbol", meaning the message needs to be decoded.
Example:
Input: +FIRE

Output: HKTG

Input: -UVQR

Output: STOP

Part 2: Custom Shift Encoding/Decoding with Variable Shifts
Encoding:

Each letter in the message is shifted according to a list of provided shifts for each position.
Example: With the shift key [2, 6, 3, 1], the letters will be shifted 2, 6, 3, and 1 positions respectively.
A "+" sign at the start indicates encoding with the provided shifts.
Decoding:

When decoding, each letter is shifted backward according to the corresponding shift key.
A "- sign" at the start indicates decoding.
Example:
Input: +FIRE 2 6 3 1

Output: HOUF

Input: -UZRQ 2 6 3 1

Output: STOP
