Building the Binary Search Tree: Inserting input data sequentially into the BST following its properties.
Deleting Nodes: If duplicate data is found during insertion, the corresponding node is deleted from the tree.
Outputting Node Data: Displaying the data of all nodes in the tree, along with each nodeâ€™s left child and right child in sequence.
